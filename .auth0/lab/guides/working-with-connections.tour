Bulk imports are useful for migrating users from an existing database or service to Auth0. This extension is intended for simple use cases. For large bulk import jobs, writing a custom script that uses the Management API is recommended.  \n\n1. #### If you're not already logged in, log in to the Auth0 Dashboard and ensure that you're on your *dev-* tenant.  \n\n1. #### In the left-hand navigation, click _Applications > APIs_.  \n\n    The _APIs_ list view is displayed. Notice that an API already exists for your tenant, the _Auth0 Management API_.  \n\n    Yes, that is right we use Auth0 to secure our own APIs! The Management API is a system API with an identifier of _[https://{yourTenantName}.{yourRegion}.auth0.com/api/v2](https://{yourTenantName}.{yourRegion}.auth0.com/api/v2)_.  \n\n1. #### Click the _Auth0 Management API_ link to display the _Settings_ for this API.  \n\n    Note the warning alerting you to the fact this is a special API.  \n\n1. #### Click the _Permissions_ tab located at the top of the page.  \n\n    These are all the fine grain permissions available for this API.  \n\n    ![profile-12](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/profile-12.gif)  \n\n1. #### Click the _API Explorer_ tab located at the top of the page.  \n \n    The API Explorer can be used to explore and prototype calls to the API without having to write a line of code. **If you've never used the API Explorer before, you will need to click _Create & Authorize Test Application_ on this page for the API Explorer to work.** \n    \n    ![profile-13](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/profile-13.gif)  \n\n1. #### Click the _Copy_ button to the right of the Access Token.  \n\n    ![profile-14](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/profile-14.gif)  \n\n\n1. #### Scroll down to the _Using this token in the API Explorer_ section. \n\n1. #### Click the _Management API Explorer_ link listed in step 1.\n    The _Management API Explorer_ will open in a new tab. Feel free to bookmark this tool, it is quite useful. It can always be found at [_https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2_](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).  \n\n    ![profile-16](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/profile-16.gif)  \n\n1. #### Click the _SET API TOKEN_ button located in the upper right corner of the page.  \n\n    The _Set Management API Token_ modal dialog is displayed.  \n\n1. #### Paste the Access Token into the _API Token_ field and click the _Set Token_ button.\n    The Explorer will update to show your tenant domain and the allowed scopes provided by the Access Token in the left-hand navigation.  \n\n1. #### Scroll the left-hand navigation down to the _Jobs_ section and select the _Jobs_ link.  \n\n1. #### Select _Create Import Users Job_.\n     Looking at the documentation for this endpoint, you can see it requires a _POST_ request to _/api/v2/jobs/users-imports_ with an access token containing the _create:users_ scope.  \n    \n1. #### Examine the Required Body Parameters. \n    Notice that you will need the *connection_id* of the connection you want to import the users into. You will also need to upload a [JSON-formatted file](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-import-database-schema-and-examples) of the *users* you wish to import. These two parameters are required. The remaining parameters are optional.\n  \n1. #### Get the Connection ID for the *Contoso-Users* Database Connection.  \n    1. Click back to the tab with your Auth0 Management Dashboard and navigate to *Authentication* > *Database*.\n    1. Click on *Contoso-Users*\n    1. Locate the label *Database Identifier* near the top of this screen (starts with *con_*).\n    1. Copy the connection ID (**including** the prefix *con_*).\n    \n1. #### Return to the API Explorer tab and paste in the connection ID you copied in the *connection_id* field \n      \n1. #### Download the JSON file\n    1. Click the following link and it will open in a new tab: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auth0/auth0-product-education-labs/main/data/bulk-import-users.json\n    1. Save the file by going to *File* > *Save Page As* in your browser. Choose a location where you can easily locate the file.\n      \n1. #### Upload the file to the API Explorer and Issue the Request.\n    1. Click the *users* field to open your system's file explorer.\n    1. Navigate to where you saved *bulk-import-users.json* locally.\n    1. Click *Open* to upload the file API Explorer.\n    1. Scroll down and click *Test Endpoint* to issue the request. \n    \n    Note that you should get a 202 HTTP response indicating that the job was accepted. Once the job completes, you will see that the users have been imported into the _Contoso-Users_ database connection. \n    ![return and view the users in the database](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/connections-24.gif)  \n    \n1. ### Check that the users were successfully imported. \n    1. Select *User Management* from the left navigation.\n    1. Select  *Users*\n    1. You should see the newly imported users with a value of *Contoso-Users* under the *Connection* column.\n    ![return and view the users in the database](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/connections-23.gif)  \n\n1. ### Enable the User-Password-Authentication Database Connection again.\n    1.
